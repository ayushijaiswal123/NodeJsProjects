Installing a single package
You can also install a specific package by running

npm install <package-name>
Often youâ€™ll see more flags added to this command:

--save installs and adds the entry to the package.json file dependencies
--save-dev installs and adds the entry to the package.json file devDependencies
The difference is mainly that devDependencies are usually development tools, like a testing library, while dependencies are bundled with the app in production.
