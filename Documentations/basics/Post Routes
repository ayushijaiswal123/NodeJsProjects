The Post-
There are many ways to perform an HTTP POST request in Node.js, depending on the abstraction level you want to use.

Example -
router.post("/category/create/:userId",
    isSignedIn,
    isAuthenticated,
);

In this Example the "/category/create/:userId" it is the address of route with user_id, isAuthenticated & isSignedIn are the middelware.
